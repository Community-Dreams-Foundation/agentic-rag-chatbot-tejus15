# Agentic RAG Chatbot - Hackathon Challenge

## Overview
Build a chatbot (Web App or CLI) that demonstrates how you’d ship an AI-first product feature:
- **File-grounded Q&A (RAG)** with **citations**
- **Durable memory** written to markdown
- *(Optional)* **Safe compute** tool calling with Open-Meteo time series analysis

You may implement one feature or multiple. Partial implementations are acceptable.

## Participant Info (Required)
- Full Name: TEJUS SANJAY SHARMA
- Email: tejus98sharma@gmail.com
- GitHub Username:tejus15

## FEATURES

### Feature A - File Upload + RAG (Core)
Users can:
- Upload files and add them to a RAG pipeline (parse → chunk → index)
- Ask questions later and receive answers grounded in uploaded content
- Provide **citations** pointing to source chunks/sections

**Minimum expectation:** working ingestion + retrieval + grounded response + citations.

Suggested test data: arXiv PDFs/HTML (open access).

Extra points:
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings), reranking, metadata filters
- Smart chunking (section-aware, semantic boundaries)
- Knowledge-graph flavored RAG

---

### Feature B - Persistent Memory (Core-ish)
Add a memory subsystem that writes selective, high-signal knowledge to:

- `USER_MEMORY.md`  
  Store user-specific facts worth remembering.  
  Example: “User is a Project Finance Analyst”, “Prefers weekly summaries on Mondays”.

- `COMPANY_MEMORY.md`  
  Store org-wide learnings useful to colleagues.  
  Example: “Asset Management interfaces often with Project Finance”, “Recurring workflow bottleneck is X”.

Rules:
- **Selective** (no transcript dumping)
- **High-signal and reusable**
- **Avoid storing secrets or sensitive information**

Implementation hint (optional):
Use an internal decision structure like:
`{should_write, target, summary, confidence}` and only append when confident.

---

### Feature C - Safe Python Sandbox + Open-Meteo (Optional)
Spin up a Python environment using llm-sandbox (or similar isolation) and allow the chatbot to execute an analysis task by calling a public time series API.

Use this API (no key required): Open-Meteo (historical + forecast weather time series).

- **https://open-meteo.com/**

The Chatbot should:
- Call Open-Meteo for a location/time range
- Retrieve time series data
- Compute basic analytics (rolling averages, volatility, missingness checks, anomaly flags, etc.)
- Return a clear explanation of findings

We care about **safe execution boundaries + clean tool interface**, not perfect data science.

---

## Submission Rules (Important)

### 1) Any language / any stack
You may use any language, framework, model, and any vector DB (FAISS/Chroma/pgvector/etc.).

### 2) One universal judge command (Required)
Judges must be able to run:

```bash
make sanity
```

Your `make sanity` must:

* Run a minimal end-to-end flow (based on what you implemented)
* Produce this file:

```text
artifacts/sanity_output.json
```

Judges may also run:

```bash
bash scripts/sanity_check.sh
```

(This script runs `make sanity` and validates the output format.)

### 3) Video Walkthrough Link (Required)

Add your video link here:

PASTE YOUR LINK HERE

## 4) Important
Submissions missing the Participant Info block may be deprioritized during review.

---

## GitHub Classroom Submission (Required)

### Step 1 — Create your submission repo
1) Open the **GitHub Classroom invite link** provided to you after registration.
2) Accept the assignment.
3) GitHub Classroom will automatically create a **new repository under your GitHub account**.
   - This new repo is your official submission repo.

Important:
- Do **not** submit work in the **agentic-rag-chatbot-template** repository. That is the starter/template repo.
- You must complete your work in the **repository created for you by GitHub Classroom** after you accept the assignment link.
- Only the GitHub Classroom-created repo will be evaluated.

### Step 2 — Work in your submission repo
Clone your Classroom repo and push your commits as usual.

### Step 3 — What you must include before the deadline
In your Classroom repo:
- Fill in the **Quick Start** section in `README.md` (exact run commands)
- Paste your **Video Walkthrough** link in `README.md`
- Ensure `make sanity` works and generates:
  - `artifacts/sanity_output.json`
- Ensure your app writes memory to:
  - `USER_MEMORY.md`
  - `COMPANY_MEMORY.md`

### Step 4 — Final submission
Your submission is automatic once your code is pushed to your Classroom repo.
No separate zip upload is required unless explicitly instructed.

# Agentic RAG with Persistent Memory
An intelligent document assistant that doesn't just read your files—it learns about **you** and **your company** over time.

## Participant Info
*   **Name:** TEJUS SANJAY SHARMA
*   **GitHub Username:** tejus15

## Video Walkthrough
**[PASTE YOUR YOUTUBE/LOOM LINK HERE]**
*(e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...)*

---

## Quick Start
Follow these exact steps to run the application locally.

**1. Clone and Enter Repository** <br/>
git clone https://github.com/Community-Dreams-Foundation/agentic-rag-chatbot-tejus15.git <br/>
cd cd agentic-rag-chatbot-tejus15


**2. Install Dependencies**<br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Configure Environment** <br/>
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API Key:<br/>
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx...

**4. Run the App**<br/>
Launch the UI:<br/>
streamlit run app.py

**5. Run Sanity Check (For Judges)**<br/>
To verify the system works without opening the UI, run the automated test suite:<br/>

***Option A: Using Make (Recommended)***<br/>
make sanity

<br/>This will generate a success report at artifacts/sanity_output.json.

## Key Features
**1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**<br/>
***Upload:*** Supports .txt and .pdf files.<br/>
***Ingest:*** Splits documents into chunks and embeds them using OpenAI Embeddings.<br/>
***Retrieve:*** Uses ChromaDB (Local Vector Store) to find relevant context for your questions.<br/>
***Cite:*** Every answer provides sources to the exact text chunk used.<br/>

**2. Agentic Memory (The "Brain")**<br/>
Unlike standard RAG bots that forget you when you close the tab, this agent possesses Persistent Memory.<br/>

***User Memory:*** Learns your name, role, and preferences (e.g., "I am a CTO," "Format answers in JSON").<br/>
***Company Memory:*** Learns organizational facts (e.g., "Budget is $50k," "Meetings are on Fridays").<br/>
***Storage:*** Memories are stored in USER_MEMORY.md and COMPANY_MEMORY.md, allowing them to survive server restarts.<br/>
